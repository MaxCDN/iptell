iptell.io - hello
======
ipTelligence is a service for finding out info about a domain.  It is a web service written in node.js.

The first application is to give an IP or hostname and return the hosting providers and favicon for the OpsPanel backends section.

We bootstrapped this very quickly and will make it open to add hostnames (through github).  Thanks JD.

Sample:

request: cdn-tools.com
